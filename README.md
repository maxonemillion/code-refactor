# code-refactor

Bootcamp Homework Assignment #1

## PURPOSE

The purpose of this assigment was to clean up the code provided and make it more accessible. I did so, and left it cleaner than I found it on both the index.html and style.css pages.

## WHAT I LEARNED

I learned the importance of cleaning up code. The original version of this was cluttered, disorganized, and contained broken links. The CSS elements were completely out of order.
